  ```json doc-gen:file
  {
    "file": "./examples/react/_configs/global.css",
    "codeblock": {
      "lang": "css",
      "meta": "title=\"global.css\""
    }
  }
  ```

  **Configure tailwind**

  ```json doc-gen:file
  {
    "file": "./examples/react/_configs/tw-config.js",
    "codeblock": {
      "lang": "js",
      "meta": "title=\"tailwind-config.js\""
    }
  }
  ```
  </Step>
